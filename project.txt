Project algorithm (tentative):
- scrape words from most popular English words site - store in array
- create a graph
- for each word in the array...
	- Go to the etymonline site for that word
	- Scrape the word's ancestor words and their language or language family
	- for each ancestor word...
		- Add a new edge in the graph from ancestor word to modern English word
- Either return a representation of the graph or use a library to graphically display the graph



- Graph production library: NetworkX
- Graph visualization tool: Cytoscape

To do:
- Install requests library (DONE)
- Create file (DONE)
- import requests library and networkX library (DONE)
- request html from a website containing a list of most common English words (possibly EF's list of
	the 3000 most common English words?) (DONE)
- create a graph G
- create for loop to iterate through the common English words
- save graph as XGMML
- import graph into cytoscape
- save language terms from 'Introduction and Explanation' page (DONE)
- Phase 1: check for mentions of terms in <p> elements
	~ graph English words to their languages/families/terms
	
- Phase 2: check for mentions of other words and their terms in <p> and <span> elements
	~ graph words to words
	~ each word node will have an attribute stating the language/family/term
